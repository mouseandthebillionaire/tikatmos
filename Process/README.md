## 03.03.22 - More Interface Display Graphic Mockups
The next set of interface display scenes that are moving forward in the visual design process are the music manipulation and where's waldo scenes. 

The Waldo scene needed some framing and visual symmetry with the over arching space mall style, so we tried to get a sort of lense view of the store with a blueprint like background to frame the top down view of the mini-game.

The music manipulation scene gets it's visual style from the sort of retro music tech style. It made sense to mirror the physical equivalent when designing its virtual representation.

## 02.03.22 - Interface Display Graphic Mockups
Moving forward with the interface mockups, we have digitized the ideas for the plant care and audio tuning scenes.

The plant care scene has an empty spot for a slider interaction, a draining water meter that can be partially replenished with a button press, a rotating light source that you have to line up to the direction of your plant, a growth meter, and a variety of other less functional interface bibs and bobs.

The audio tuner scene will allow the player to tune to the right frequency in order to understand the being that has appeared at the information booth. There are three frequencies that need to be tuned into and there is color feedback for each about how close you are to the target.

## 02.01.22 - Multi-Display Work
Worked out the secondary display for the device. There are a few issues with the screen not resizing properly. To fix, we have been changing the window style (windowed, maximum vs. windowed) and that seems to be fixing the problem, but it's not a permanent solution.

The Window_Launch scene launches a secondary scene on the secondary display, which then is responsible for switching the "applications." 
We might spend some time thinking on how that could integrated to the main Game Manager for ease of later coding.... maybe.

Also of note, if the secondary display is an iPad, it can be run wireless, which leads to some super interesting future possibilities.



## 01.28.22 - Interface Ideation
Since the game will be featuring two displays: the main info booth looking into the mall, and the mall interface options screen, we need to start thinking about how the interface screen will be laid out. One of the scenes for the interface display will be controlling the wellbeing of your desk plant. This is a nice simple place to start as far as interface, since the controls and options are a little more straight forward. Below is an idea of what the various interface options might look like.

## 01.25.22 - Mall Scene Concepts
The next step in defining the visual style of the mall, is probably to ya know... try drawing what the mall might look like! So the next set of concept pieces look to what the mall spaces might look like on the inside. Referencing actual mall interiors, our concepts are shown below.

These concepts feel in line with the vibe we are going for and have a lot of fun retro elements to build on. While the final mall scenes will be much busier and full of miscelaneous sentient furniture and objects, these give a nice idea of the internal spaces and theme.

## 01.19.22 - Concept Art Exploration
Building on the retro-futurism style, we wanted to explore what that might look like to define the direction of the visual assets. Below is a set of both machine and visual explorations to work towards that consistant look and feel. Our favorite by far is the fourth option which has a nice balance of soft colors and vintage _Jetsons_ feel, so the art assets will try to head in that direction for the future.

## 01.19.22 - Retro Futurism Inspo
Out of our initial brainstorming came this idea of theming the visual direction of the game toward a sort of retro-futurism vibe. Inspired by the wacky ways in which people imagined the future straight out of the _Jetsons_, we took a little time to draw from these styles and create some initial mood boards.

And some fun fonts too!

There are a ton of funky retro machines that will probably influence the physical interface of the game design, here is sort of what we are thinking for that vibe:

## 01.11.22 - The Birth of the Space Mall
**Brainstorm Session Notes:**
- Multiple streams of info
- Infinite dungeon mall? -> Being separate and in a managereal role
- Combination of macro and micro management
- Dialing into the language translator
- Cash register or something for many transfers and exchanges
- Retro futurism vibe

**Future + Mall + Management suff** -> Maybe it's in space
